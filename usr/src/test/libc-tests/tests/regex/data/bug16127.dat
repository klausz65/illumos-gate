NOTE test cases for illumos bug 16127
#
# This involved an erroneously implemented optimization which reduces
# single-element sets to an exact match with a single codepoint.
# Match sets record small-codepoint characters in a bitmap and large-codepoint
# characters in an array; the optimization would falsely trigger if either
# the bitmap or the array was a singleton, ignoring the members of the other
# side of the set.
#
# To exercise this, we construct sets which have one member of one side and
# one or more of the other, and verify that all members can be found.
